## Definition:
## Objective, Godly Awareness of Self and Situation

### Objective
Observing, as though we are watching from another perspective
### Godly
Prayerfully looking for God's perspective
### Awareness
We view as if from the outside. 
### Self
We recognize and evaluate our own thoughts and feelings
- What are we thinking and feeling?
- Why?
### Situation
We recognize the truth of what is happening around us.
- Circumstances
- People

## Mindfulness in Conflict
Find the truth and grace perspective.
John 1:14 John identifies Jesus' character as "full of grace and truth".

### What is the truth?
What happened?
Why did it happen?
### What is the grace?
Why did she do that?
Why did I do that?
How has Jesus covered this?

## Examples
I feel very angry at Joe for ignoring me at the last meeting.

I feel insecure when I am around Jane.

## Maintaining Daily Mindfulness ("Spiritfulness")

1. **Begin your day** with prayer and reading of Scripture. 
    
2. **Prepare your heart**. Invite the Holy Spirit to fill you, mindful of the fruit of the Spirit.
    
3. **Take short relaxation breaks.** Throughout the day, take short breaks to engage in mindful prayer exercises. Inhale grace and thanks, and breathe out stress. Check your emotions: what are you feeling and why? Deal with anything not right.
    
4. **Documenting/journaling.** Reflect on your interactions with clients and co-workers, and write [[Progress Notes\|Progress Notes]], [[Personal Journal\|Personal Journal]] entries, [[Team Agenda Notes\|Team Agenda Notes]] and [[Blessages\|Blessages]].     
   
5. **Practice Active Listening**: When interacting with the girls or colleagues, practice active listening by giving your full attention to the speaker without judgment or interruption. Truly hear what they are saying and respond with empathy and compassion.
    
6. **Pray for others:** 
	1. Girls in the program 
	2. Co-workers
	    
7. **Practice Forgiveness and Letting Go**: Throughout the day, practice forgiveness for yourself and others. Let go of any resentments or frustrations, allowing God's grace to flow through you.
    
8. **End-of-Day Reflection**: Before ending your day, take a few moments for reflection and gratitude. Review the events of the day with a spirit of openness and self-awareness, acknowledging both challenges and moments of growth. Thank God for His presence and guidance throughout the day.

## Living in wonder
### I am alive!
### God loves me!
### God's wonders are everywhere!
### Each person is God's image!

> Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 1 John 4:11-12 

## Being transformed
> Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. … Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment  Romans 12:2-3

## Other Mindfulness/Prayerfulness Habits

### **Mindful Stretching**:
**Practice**: Integrate gentle stretching into your day with full awareness. Pay attention to how each stretch feels in your body, noticing areas of tension and relaxation.
**Habit-Building**: Dedicate a few minutes in the morning or evening for a mindful stretching routine. Set a specific time and follow a simple sequence of stretches, focusing on your breath and bodily sensations throughout.
### **Mindful Breathing Breaks**:
 **Practice**: Take short breaks throughout the day to focus on your breathing. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.
 **Habit-Building**: Set reminders on your phone or computer to take these breathing breaks. Start with one break per hour and adjust as needed.
### **Body Scan Meditation**:
**Practice:** Perform a body scan meditation to bring awareness to different parts of your body. Lie down or sit comfortably, and mentally scan from your toes to your head, noticing any sensations.
**Habit-Building**: Incorporate this practice before bed to help relax and improve sleep. Make it a nightly routine to wind down from the day.
### **Mindful Walking**:
**Practice**: When walking, focus on the sensations of your feet touching the ground, the rhythm of your steps, and your surroundings.
**Habit-Building**: Integrate mindful walking into daily activities, such as walking to work, during lunch breaks, or taking a short walk after dinner.
### **Gratitude Journaling**:
**Practice**: Spend a few minutes each day writing down things you are grateful for. Reflect on positive experiences and moments.
 **Habit-Building**: Set aside a specific time each day, such as before bed or after waking up, to write in your gratitude journal. Keep the journal in a visible place as a reminder.
### **Mindful Listening**:
**Practice**: When conversing with others, give them your full attention. Listen without planning your response, and notice their tone, expressions, and words. See their what they are feeling.
**Habit-Building**: Make a conscious effort to practice mindful listening in at least one conversation per day. Reflect on your interactions and how it feels to be fully present.

### Tips for Building and Sustaining Mindfulness Habits:

- **Start Small**: Begin with short, manageable practices and gradually increase the time and frequency as you become more comfortable.
- **Consistency**: Practice at the same time each day to create a routine. Consistency helps reinforce the habit.
- **Set Reminders**: Use alarms, sticky notes, or apps to remind yourself to practice mindfulness throughout the day.
- **Track Progress**: Keep a journal to record your mindfulness practices and reflect on your experiences and progress.
- **Stay Patient**: Building new habits takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and recognize that consistency is more important than perfection.
