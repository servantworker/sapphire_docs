## The Problem: At-Risk Teens and Authority

- Experiences of neglect and abuse cause many at-risk teens to distrust authority. They have feld misunderstood or oppressed by parents and teachers. This distrust can lead to defiance, disengagement, and increased behavioral problems.
- In an authority-oriented culture like Thailand, where respect for elders and authority is emphasized, these challenges can be amplified. 
- The Thai cultural emphasis on maintaining harmony and avoiding conflict can create a dilemma for these teens. They feel misunderstood and unseen, even angry, but don't have a way to talk about it. A girl might feel that she is a bad person even for thinking this way. 

## Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Can Help

- **Restoring Trust in Authority:** CPS involves teens in the problem-solving process, allowing them to voice their concerns and actively participate in finding solutions. This shared approach can help rebuild trust by showing that authority figures are not just there to impose rules but also to listen and understand.
- **Empowering Teens Without Undermining Authority:** CPS does not diminish the role of authority but enhances it by giving teens a sense of agency within a structured process. Adults still guide the conversation, but the emphasis on collaboration helps teens feel respected and valued.
- **Fostering Mutual Understanding:** CPS creates space for teens and authority figures to better understand each otherâ€™s perspectives. By focusing on identifying the root causes of behavior, the process helps uncover underlying issues that might otherwise go unnoticed in a more top-down, authoritarian approach.
- **Harmonizing with Cultural Values:** CPS aligns with the value of authority and harmony by offering a calm, structured environment for resolving conflicts collaboratively, helping to de-escalate tense situations and reduce the risk of confrontation.

## Benefits of CPS for At-Risk Teens

- **Increased Engagement and Ownership:** When teens are actively involved in solving their own problems, they are more likely to engage in the process and take ownership of their behavior. This sense of responsibility can lead to lasting behavioral improvements.
- **Developing Emotional and Social Skills:** CPS helps teens develop critical skills like empathy, negotiation, and perspective-taking. These skills are essential for navigating social relationships and improving interactions with authority figures.
- **Reducing Defiance and Conflict:** At-risk teens are less likely to act out when they feel that their opinions and perspectives are valued. CPS reduces the need for punitive measures, which can often worsen behavior, by addressing problems collaboratively and constructively.
  
## What is Collaborative Decision Making?
