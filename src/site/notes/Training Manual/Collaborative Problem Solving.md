# Introduction

Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) is an effective approach in social work to help clients address and resolve personal problems. This method involves the client and the social worker working together to understand the issue, brainstorm solutions, and implement a plan.

# Purpose

- **Empowerment**: Enable clients to actively participate in solving their own problems.
- **Effective Solutions**: Develop practical and sustainable solutions tailored to the client's unique situation.
- **Skill Development**: Enhance the client's problem-solving, decision-making, and coping skills.
- **Strengthened Relationships**: Build a supportive and collaborative relationship between the client and the social worker.

# Key Components

## Preparation

### Prayer
- First, pray and listen to the Holy Spirit. Release any negative emotion like anger or frustration. Forgive the client for having the problem! 
- The Spirit will give you insight–sometimes even a word of knowledge or wisdom. But don’t assume that this word is the final answer–the goal is for the client to understand and accept the problem, and want to change. 

- Ensure mutual understanding between the client and the social worker.

### Information Gathering
 - Collect relevant information about the problem.
 - Understand the context, causes, and effects of the problem from the client's perspective.

### Choose how and when to meet with the client
