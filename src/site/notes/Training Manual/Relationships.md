## Intention vs. Interpretation
- I only see my intention. You see my behavior and interpret my intention.




## Beware of Triangles 

Relationship triangles in the workplace occur when three people work together, but two people work more closely (or are closer friends) than the other. This can foster mistrust in several ways:

### Feeling ignored

- When two people in the triangle share a closer relationship (either personal or professional), the third person may feel left out or unimportant. This can lead to resentment, with the excluded person doubting the fairness of the work environment.

### **Gossip and Miscommunication**

- Triangles can encourage gossip or behind-the-back conversations. For example, one person might talk about the third individual in their absence, either sharing complaints or confidential information.
- When co-workers feel that private discussions about them are happening, it undermines trust and creates an atmosphere of suspicion.

### **Divisiveness**

- Triangles can polarize relationships, with two individuals forming a closer bond while distancing themselves from the third. This can lead to divisions within teams, creating an "us vs. them" mentality.
- The third person may feel isolated, questioning the loyalty and motives of the other two, which can fracture team cohesion.

### **Breeding Insecurity**

- The third person in a triangle may begin to question their own value in the workplace. Seeing others form stronger alliances without being included can lead to insecurity and a lack of confidence in the fairness of workplace dynamics.
- This insecurity can contribute to a cycle of mistrust, where people become overly cautious, defensive, or passive-aggressive.

In summary, relationship triangles in the workplace create an environment where communication breakdowns, exclusion, favoritism, and hidden agendas can flourish, all of which undermine trust among co-workers. Maintaining open, direct, and inclusive communication can help prevent these damaging dynamics.
