# Introduction
Oh no!
## Joys
## Trials
## 


# Teen Development
## Physical Changes
- Growth spurts
- Development of secondary sexual characteristics (breast development in girls, facial and body hair in boys)
- Changes in body composition (increase in muscle mass for boys, increase in body fat for girls)
- Development of reproductive organs
- Changes in skin (acne)
- Growth of pubic and underarm hair
## Hormonal Changes
- Increase in sex hormones (testosterone in boys, estrogen and progesterone in girls)
- Changes in growth hormone levels
- Changes in adrenal hormones (adrenal androgens)
- Fluctuations in mood-related hormones (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, adrenaline)
## Emotional and Psychological Changes
- Mood swings
- Increased sensitivity to stress
- Development of a more complex emotional life
- Heightened sensitivity to peer acceptance and social dynamics
- Development of a stronger sense of identity and independence
## Cognitive Changes
- Development of abstract and critical thinking
	- Improved problem-solving skills
	- Greater capacity for reasoning and understanding complex concepts
- Increased focus on future planning and goal-setting
## Social Changes
- Changes in relationships with family (seeking more independence)
- Increased importance of peer relationships
- Development of romantic and sexual relationships
- Exploration of social identity and roles


# Challenges

## Success pressure

## Social pressure
### Friend drama

## Family pressure
โต้แล้ว "I'm already grown"

## Self pressure -> self doubt
- Am I pretty?
- Am I smart?
- Am I cool?
- Am I interesting?
- Am I wanted?
## Future pressure
### It starts to matter


# Hormones Hormones Hormones

## Estrogen 
- Influences the levels and activity of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. 
- When estrogen levels are stable or increasing, girls may experience improved mood and a sense of well-being. However, fluctuations in estrogen levels, particularly premenstrually, can lead to mood swings, irritability, and emotional sensitivity.

## Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)

Many girls and women experience PMS, a condition characterized by emotional and physical symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation and before menstruation). Symptoms can include mood swings, irritability, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.
The drop in estrogen levels towards the end of the menstrual cycle is a significant contributor to these mood changes. The rapid decline can lead to a decrease in serotonin levels, contributing to the emotional symptoms of PMS.

## Anxiety and Depression

Fluctuating estrogen levels during puberty can contribute to an increased risk of developing anxiety and depression. Adolescents undergoing these hormonal changes may experience heightened emotional responses and mood instability.

Some studies suggest that estrogen has a protective effect against depression, so lower levels or rapid fluctuations can increase susceptibility to depressive symptoms.

## Stress Response
Estrogen can modulate the stress response by affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which controls the release of cortisol, the stress hormone. Estrogen can enhance the body's ability to manage stress, but fluctuations can lead to increased stress sensitivity and emotional reactivity.

## Mechanisms of Estrogen’s Influence
### Neurotransmitter Interaction
- Estrogen enhances the synthesis and release of serotonin, as well as the sensitivity of serotonin receptors, contributing to its mood-stabilizing effects.
- It also affects dopamine and norepinephrine systems, which are involved in reward, motivation, and alertness.
### Brain Structure and Function
- Estrogen impacts brain areas involved in mood regulation, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. These areas are critical for processing emotions and executive function.
- During puberty, the brain undergoes significant remodeling, and estrogen influences this process, affecting emotional and cognitive functions.

Summary:
Estrogen levels have a substantial impact on mood in girls, particularly during puberty when hormone levels are fluctuating. Stable or increasing levels of estrogen can have mood-stabilizing and enhancing effects, while fluctuations, particularly decreases, can contribute to mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and depression. Understanding these effects can help in managing and supporting the emotional well-being of adolescent girls during this transitional period.

### Long-term Impact of Childhood Trauma on Estrogen

- Persistent Hormonal Imbalances
- Affect reproductive health, mood, and overall well-being.
	- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
	- menstrual irregularities
	- early menopause

## Synaptic pruning
- Not yet fully understood
- Elimination of synaptic connections
- 
- Estrogen influences this process, and an early surge in estrogen can alter the timing and extent of pruning in the PFC.
- Estrogen can accelerate myelination, but if this process occurs too rapidly or prematurely, it may lead to suboptimal development of neural circuits.

## Earlier maturation of the PFC prefrontal cortex
- Can result in imbalance 
- PFC might be out of sync with limbic system
“Too smart for their own good.”

## Potential for reduced plasticity
- can limit capacity for learning 

**Study by Peper and Dahl (2013)**
**Research by Blakemore (2012)**

Heightened emotional reactivity: With a more developed limbic system and less PFC control, girls may experience stronger emotional responses, mood swings, and difficulty regulating emotions.

Increased risk-taking: The imbalance can lead to impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors, as the reward-seeking limbic system overpowers the underdeveloped PFC's inhibitory control.

- Vulnerability to mental health issues: This imbalance is linked to higher rates of anxiety, depression, and substance abuse in adolescence and young adulthood.
- Social challenges: Girls may struggle with social interactions and decision-making in complex social situations due to the difficulty in managing emotions and impulses.
- Long-term effects: Some research suggests that this early imbalance might have lasting effects on brain architecture, potentially influencing cognitive and emotional function into adulthood.
