## Attachment vs. Survival
- We are made for attachment (love).
- We are made to depend on and care for each other.
- A baby begins with complete dependency
- In a short time, a baby begins to "care for" others by smiling and laughing.
- As children grow, their dependency changes to mutual attachment.
- Neglect and abuse short-circuits this process.
	- The child learns that caregivers are not dependable.
	- The child becomes controlled by fear.
