	# We can heal when we’re safe.
We can’t heal until we’re safe. 

Hurt people, when unsafe, only get hurt more.

# Salvation = safety

- Galatians 6:1

# Acceptance
# Truth and grace
- We don’t help people by avoiding the truth.
- We let people know if something is wrong, hard, dangerous….


A safe person is 
- consistent.
- accepting.
- a listener.
- polite.
- careful.
- mindful.
- positive
- truthful.
- gracious.

- sees potential instead of problem.

# The fruit of the Spirit
