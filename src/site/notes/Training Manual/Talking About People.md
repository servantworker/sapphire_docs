## Introduction
- What would we talk about if we couldn’t talk about other people? Food? Weather? Things would get boring quickly.
- In working in a profession that helps other people we need to talk about people on a daily basis. 
	- Clients
	- Co-workers

- Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear. Ephesians 4:29


## Gossip vs ???
- It is interesting that both English and Thai don't have a word that means talking positively about others. Only negative.
- English is especially interesting: "gossip" started out to mean "God sibling" centuries ago. Women who supported each other in childbirth shared news and stories.
- By the 1500's it became negative. 
- This negative tendency says something about human nature, doesn't it?  

The Thai word **นินทา** (ninta) means "gossip" or "speaking ill of someone behind their back." The etymology of this word traces back to **Pali** and **Sanskrit** origins, as many Thai words are influenced by these classical languages due to their use in Buddhist texts and ancient Indian culture.

- **นินทา** comes from the Pali/Sanskrit word **"nindā" (निन्दा)**, which means "blame," "reproach," "disparagement," or "censure."

## Talking About Other Workers

When talking about co-workers, it’s important to maintain professionalism, respect, and a positive environment. Here are key principles to keep in mind:

### Respect Confidentiality
Avoid sharing personal information or private details that could breach trust or confidentiality.
Do not discuss sensitive workplace matters in public or non-work-related settings.
### Be Constructive, Not Critical
Frame feedback or discussions around co-workers in a constructive manner. Focus on behaviors and actions, not personal traits.
If discussing a problem, offer solutions or positive suggestions.
### Maintain Professionalism
Stick to professional topics and avoid gossip or negative conversations about others.
Uphold a respectful tone, even when discussing conflicts or disagreements.
### Focus on Facts, Not Assumptions
Base your comments on observable facts and avoid speculating about a co-worker's intentions or abilities.
Avoid jumping to conclusions without sufficient information.
### Promote Collaboration and Team Spirit
Highlight positive contributions and teamwork.
Acknowledge and celebrate your co-workers' achievements.
### Be Mindful of Your Audience
Tailor your comments to your audience, understanding that what might be appropriate in one setting may not be in another.
Avoid speaking about co-workers in a way that could cause misunderstandings or spread rumors.
### Assume Positive Intent
Approach discussions about co-workers with the assumption that they have good intentions, even if mistakes have been made.
This fosters a culture of trust and support.
### Use “I” Statements
When discussing concerns, use “I” statements to express how their actions affected you, rather than placing blame (e.g., “I felt overwhelmed when X happened,” instead of “You didn’t help.”).
### Keep Emotional Distance
Avoid letting personal feelings cloud your judgment. Stay objective and unemotional, especially when discussing workplace issues.
### Be Open to Different Perspectives
Understand that co-workers may have different working styles, communication preferences, or viewpoints. Respect these differences and be willing to adjust your approach if necessary.


## Laughing/joking about others: when is it ok?

People make us laugh. It's part of enjoying each other. But we all know it can be very wrong. It is therefore essential for workers to understand the difference between humor that builds warmth and jokes that can hurt people, either the person being laughed at or others who may feel awkward about it. 

### **Wholesome Laughter**

#### **Inclusive and Friendly**
- Laughing _with_ co-workers, not _at_ them, ensures that humor is shared and enjoyed by everyone involved.
- Make sure jokes are light-hearted and meant to foster team bonding, rather than targeting someone.
#### **Respect Boundaries**    
- Be mindful of each co-worker’s comfort level with humor. Some people may enjoy jokes, while others may not appreciate being the subject of laughter.
- Avoid bringing up personal matters or inside jokes that could alienate others.
#### **Self-Deprecating Humor**
- Laughing at your own harmless mistakes or quirks can help break tension and foster humility.
- This type of humor can make the workplace more approachable, as long as it's done in moderation and doesn’t involve self-undermining.
#### **Shared Funny Moments**
- Reflecting on shared experiences, like a light-hearted incident or common challenges, can create bonding opportunities. These are moments where everyone laughs _together_, making it clear there’s no ill will.
#### **Positive Tone**
- Ensure the tone of the joke or laughter is positive and doesn’t come across as sarcasm, bitterness, or passive aggression.
#### **Know the Context**
- Timing is key. Laughing together during breaks, casual moments, or team-building events is more appropriate than during serious meetings or tense situations.

### **Inappropriate Laughter**

#### **Targeting or Mocking Individuals**
- Laughing _at_ a co-worker, especially when it highlights their mistakes, personal traits, or circumstances, is disrespectful and can lead to feelings of alienation or embarrassment.
- Avoid jokes that single out someone's appearance, work performance, personality, or cultural background.
#### **Behind-the-Back Jokes**
- Laughing about co-workers behind their backs erodes trust and can contribute to a toxic work environment.
- Gossip-based humor, where someone is the subject of jokes without their knowledge, is never appropriate.
#### **Sensitive Topics**
- Avoid jokes related to personal aspects such as religion, race, gender, family situations, or any sensitive life events.
- Humor that touches on someone's insecurities or challenges (e.g., workload, career struggles) can be harmful.
#### **Laughing in Stressful or Serious Situations**
- It’s important not to laugh at another's mistakes or struggles in moments where they might be stressed or under pressure. This can feel dismissive or cruel.
- Jokes or laughter during serious discussions, disciplinary actions, or after someone has expressed frustration or vulnerability are inappropriate.
#### **Sarcastic or Passive-Aggressive Humor**
- Sarcasm or jokes that have an underlying negative message can harm relationships, even if they are masked as humor. Be wary of laughing at comments that are meant to subtly criticize or undermine someone.
#### **Exclusionary Jokes**
- Inside jokes that exclude or alienate certain co-workers can foster cliques and create division within teams. Be mindful that humor is shared and doesn’t make anyone feel left out.

### General Guideline:

The main question to ask: does the person being laughed about find the joke funny?  Or would they if they weren't there? 

### Don't Apply Your Standards to Others
Just because you are happy to have others laugh at something about you doesn't mean that another person is the same.
