## The Opposite of Addiction is Connection

It's about the feeling. 

Researchers have found that individuals who are often lonely are more likely to be addicted than others.

Positive social interactions can activate brain regions linked to reward systems, which may mitigate the craving response in individuals with addiction. In simple terms, social connection makes us feel better, reducing the need for substances. 

Community support and connection are essential components in long-term recovery from addiction.
