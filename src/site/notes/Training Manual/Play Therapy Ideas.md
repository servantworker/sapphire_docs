## Key Considerations:
### Trauma-Sensitive Approach
Be mindful of each girl's comfort level. Never push them to participate in an activity they are uncomfortable with.
### Empowerment
Let the girls take the lead in their play and creative expression.
### Reflection
After activities, it may be helpful to reflect together, asking the teen how the activity felt and if it brought up any new thoughts or emotions.
