## “Set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith, and in purity.”

## And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me. “If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.

- Workers will remind themselves daily of the infinite preciousness of each child. 
- They will take utmost care, as representatives of Jesus, to cherish, protect and lead each child in the ways of God.
