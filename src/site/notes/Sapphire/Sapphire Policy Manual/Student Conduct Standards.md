## Examples of Consequences
Here are examples of consequences that could be applied in a residential girls' program, using a tiered approach based on the severity and frequency of the infraction:

### **Tier 1: Minor Infractions**

Minor infractions are relatively low-risk behaviors that can often be corrected through reminders, redirection, or minimal interventions. Examples include minor rule-breaking, lack of cooperation, or disrespectful language.

#### Examples of Minor Infractions:

- Not following daily schedules or routines.
- Failing to complete assigned chores or tasks.
- Disrespectful behavior or language (without malice or repeated offenses).
- Tardiness to scheduled activities.
- Minor disagreements or conflicts that do not escalate.

#### **Consequences for Minor Infractions:**

1. **Verbal Warning:** A staff member addresses the behavior directly with the teen, explaining why it is inappropriate and discussing expected behavior.
2. **Reflection Time:** A brief time-out or quiet time where the teen can reflect on their actions and how they might handle things differently in the future.
3. **Loss of Privileges:** Temporary loss of certain privileges, such as recreational time, use of electronic devices, or participation in a fun activity.
4. **Restorative Conversation:** A guided conversation with a staff member to reflect on behavior, understand its impact, and discuss ways to make amends.
5. **Written Reflection:** The teen may be asked to write a reflection about their behavior, why it was problematic, and how they plan to change it moving forward.

### **Tier 2: Moderate Infractions**

Moderate infractions involve behaviors that disrupt the program, affect other participants, or show repeated non-compliance after minor consequences have been applied.

#### Examples of Moderate Infractions:

- Repeated minor infractions despite prior warnings or interventions.
- Rudeness or disrespect toward peers or staff.
- Unauthorized use of technology or social media.
- Skipping scheduled activities or curfew violations.
- Creating minor disturbances that affect the group or program activities.

#### **Consequences for Moderate Infractions:**

1. **Behavioral Contract:** The teen, along with a staff member, creates a written agreement outlining specific behavior changes needed and consequences for failing to comply.
2. **Increased Supervision:** The teen may be placed under closer supervision for a certain period to ensure compliance with rules.
3. **Community Service or Extra Chores:** The teen may be asked to perform additional chores or engage in community service activities within the program.
4. **Temporary Loss of Major Privileges:** Longer-term loss of privileges, such as weekend outings, special events, or use of personal electronics.
5. **Mediation or Peer Resolution:** A facilitated session with peers and staff to address conflicts, repair relationships, and develop positive communication strategies.

### **Tier 3: Serious Infractions**

Serious infractions are behaviors that pose a risk to the safety, well-being, or integrity of the program and its participants. These require immediate and significant consequences.

#### Examples of Serious Infractions:

- Physical aggression or fighting.
- Bullying, harassment, or threats to others.
- Possession or use of prohibited substances (drugs, alcohol, tobacco).
- Theft or damage to property.
- Repeated defiance or non-compliance with Tier 2 interventions.
- Unauthorized departure from the premises (running away).

#### **Consequences for Serious Infractions:**

1. **Loss of Privileges for Extended Periods:** Extended restriction from privileges like outings, participation in group activities, or use of personal items.
2. **Restorative Justice Circle:** A formal restorative justice process involving the teen, affected parties, staff, and possibly family members to address the harm caused and develop a plan for restitution.
3. **Parent/Guardian Involvement:** Immediate involvement of parents or guardians to discuss the infraction, consequences, and future steps.
4. **Temporary Separation from the Group:** A cooling-off period where the teen is separated from the group to de-escalate a situation or for their own safety.
5. **Behavioral Probation:** A formal probation period where continued infractions could lead to more severe consequences, such as a review for potential dismissal.
6. **Counseling or Specialized Support:** Mandatory counseling sessions, anger management classes, or other support services to address underlying issues.

### **Tier 4: Critical Infractions**

Critical infractions are the most severe types of behavior that threaten the safety, legality, or core values of the program. These usually require immediate and decisive action.

#### Examples of Critical Infractions:

- Violence resulting in serious injury.
- Possession of weapons or illegal substances.
- Repeated serious infractions with no improvement.
- Severe, targeted bullying or harassment.
- Sexual misconduct or illegal activities.

#### **Consequences for Critical Infractions:**

1. **Immediate Suspension:** Temporary suspension from the program while staff review the situation and decide on further action.
2. **Program Dismissal:** Permanent removal from the program, usually in cases where safety is at risk or all other interventions have failed.
3. **Law Enforcement Involvement:** In cases involving illegal activities, law enforcement may be contacted, and legal consequences could follow.
4. **Referral to Alternative Programs:** If the program is not a fit due to behavioral needs or safety concerns, referral to a more appropriate program or facility may be necessary.
5. **Formal Safety Planning:** Development of a safety plan involving the teen, their family, and any relevant outside agencies to ensure future safety.

These consequences are designed to be fair, consistent, and restorative whenever possible, promoting learning and personal growth rather than merely punitive measures. Would you like to explore more about any of these examples?
