Volunteer Position
# Mission
Actively support and care for workers and volunteers. 
# Capable and Called
Care Team Members must be *called* by God, *capable* of offering compassionate, thoughtful prayer, coaching and acts of kindness to Sapphire personnel. And most importantly, they must be *available*. Team members will check in regularly with workers, not simply wait to be contacted.
## Capable
Members must have a firsthand understanding of the complex challenges of caring for children on a daily basis. They must be able to listen carefully, and provide both encouragement and exhortation as needed. 
## Called
This is a matter of prioritization. Members must know that God has a special purpose for them such that they give it high priority relative to other responsibilities, including being ready to make sacrifices in their care for Sapphire workers.

# Duties
## Prayer
Pray daily for the Sapphire mission, for workers including any requests they send.
## Checking in
Contact at least one worker every week to see how she is doing, share Scripture, pray and encourage according to her need.
## Coaching
Help workers think through priorities, God-centeredness with tough cases or relationships.
## Recruit others
Share the mission of Sapphire and pray for divine appointments with others that God has called to have a part.

# Time Commitment
Team members commit to a minimum of one year, and give notice of planned departure at least 3 months in advance.
