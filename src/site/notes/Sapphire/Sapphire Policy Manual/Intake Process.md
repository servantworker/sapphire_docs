# Intake process
## Important factors
### The goal of the intake process is to help every candidate, whether accepted or not
- There is a tension between finding acceptable candidates and the risk of adding trauma through rejection
- **The intake process must therefore be very careful and methodical to reduce the risk of false hope**
### Orientation starts with intake
- A student will always remember her first impressions.
- She will begin to create expectations that will subsequently be met or disappointed. A good process will insure that her expectations are reasonably accurate.
