## [[Sapphire/Sapphire Residential Prevention Centers Overview Thai\|บ้านไพลิน ภาพรวม]]	

# Summary
Proposed is a new network of small boardings schools for young teens and preteens. These homes will not only provide opportunity for girls to grow and learn in safety,  but will serve as touchpoints to expose many to both the needs of hurting kids but best practices in caring for them, following the example of Jesus.


# Introduction
## The Problem
- Another quiet pandemic has been gripping Thailand. Between the continued downward spiral of family breakdown and the negative effects of technology/social media, children are increasingly traumatized, suffering from high anxiety, depression and dysfunctional behaviors. We see many dropping out of school (or being expelled, especially during grades 7 and 8. Many report frequent bullying.  
- Not only are school personnel barely trained in handling these kinds of issues, and there are no trained specialists, such as counselors or social workers.  
- A high percentage of kids, especially in working class environments, experience sexual exploitation at a young age. Usually the abuser is someone well known, e.g. a stepfather, uncle or neighbor.  
- Meanwhile, after a hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sex industry has fully rebounded. And while men's entertainment establishments are buzzing, the online platforms are growing. 
- The visible commercial sex industry is however only the tip of a large iceberg of exploitation, as girls are pimped to local men by older girls, young women, and in some cases, even their mothers. 
- Teen girls can be challenging to work with, even when not plagued by childhood trauma. Because most at-risk girls have experienced neglect and violence at some point 

## Girls and Boys
- The problem of sexual exploitation tends to bring girls to mind, but boys are also highly at risk, especially in the lower/working class where father absence and other instability is common.
	- Lack of role models
	- Both experience sexual abuse
	- Socialized into addictions: sex, substances, gaming
	- Social media heavily promotes narcissism. 
- This is not only about saving lives, but of saving society: making disciples who will teach others, that is, raising kids into leadership.
- There is a the very practical issue that women need husbands. While this may sound silly to a Westerner, it is indeed a reality for lower-class Thai women.

# Mission

Providing safe environments and services that allow children at risk of exploitation to grow towards becoming healthy adults and fulfilling their potential as children of God, including becoming transformational leaders. 

# Vision
## Short term
- Begin and grow a model boarding school that serves a growing number of children.
## Long term
- Advocacy: educate others on the need and how they can help
- Develop and/or assist others in developing other homes or foster care
- Provide expert services or referrals to those working with at-risk older children.
  
 
# Working Definitions 
 
- ## At-risk children
	- Children who, due to family situation and/or other factors, have a strong likelihood of entering a destructive lifestyle. 
- 
- ## Prevention
	- Activity designed to enhance the safety of at-risk children and help them avoid exploitation
- ## Intervention
	- Activity designed to rescue children who have already been exploited

"Prevention" and "Intervention" are often viewed separately, but actually they best work together.
- Intervention leads to prevention, through working with at-risk children of hurt people, or other family members. 
- Both share a common need for trauma identification and recovery. The reality is that most at-risk children have already suffered trauma, even at young ages.

# Boarding School Management

## Size and age considerations

	- But easily misused.
- Must be able to maintain never-alone guidelines
	- Zero cross-sex one-on-one
	- Same-sex one-on-one also requires some care

## Houseparents optional
- Homes can be managed with or without houseparents
- Each has advantages and disadvantages
- Non-houseparent requires more management
	- Not only scheduling but keeping continuity and consistency between workers
	- But it avoids the emotional intensity of 24-hour live-in.
- Couples as houseparents may be difficult with smaller homes due to "never alone" guidelines
