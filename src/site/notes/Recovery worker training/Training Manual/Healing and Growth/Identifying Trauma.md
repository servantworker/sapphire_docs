## Menstrual issues

> [!NOTE]
> ### Why Trauma Can Affect Menstrual Health
>  Trauma can disrupt the bodyâ€™s hormonal balance and stress response system (e.g., cortisol production), which can interfere with the menstrual cycle. In addition, emotional trauma can lead to eating disorders, substance use, or changes in physical health that further affect menstruation.

### Irregular Menstrual Cycles
- Unpredictable periods or changes in the cycle length.
- Skipping periods (amenorrhea), especially after a traumatic event.
### Painful Periods (Dysmenorrhea)
- Severe cramping or pain that may worsen due to stress or trauma.
### Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Menorrhagia)
- Unusually heavy or prolonged periods, which can be a physical response to prolonged stress or emotional distress.
### Absent Periods (Amenorrhea)
- A sudden absence of periods (in teens who had regular cycles) due to stress or emotional trauma, which can affect hormonal balance.
### Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) Intensification:
- Increased emotional symptoms like anxiety, irritability, or mood swings before menstruation, potentially intensified by underlying trauma.
### Early Onset of Menstruation (Precocious Puberty)
- Experiencing menstruation earlier than typical, sometimes linked to chronic stress or traumatic events in childhood.
### Worsening of Menstrual Symptoms
- Pre-existing menstrual symptoms, such as bloating, cramps, or fatigue, may worsen due to heightened stress or anxiety.
