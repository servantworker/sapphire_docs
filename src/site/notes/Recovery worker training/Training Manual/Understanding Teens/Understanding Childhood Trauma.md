##  Introduction
### The importance of understanding
- Explains so much behavior
- Helps us have empathy
- Helps us to not simply react to behaviors
- Helps us to treat causes, not only symptoms
### Definition of Trauma
#### Trauma is any event that causes a response of fear.

### Adult vs. Childhood Trauma
- Trauma can occur at any age. 
- Adult trauma can cause PTSD, which is emotional responses to stimuli that remind us of the event.
- Because childhood trauma occurs while the brain is still forming, it can cause the brain to mature in an unbalanced way. 
- Kids in the risk group that are likely to enter a residential program most often have had multiple kinds of trauma that occurred over many years. 
- Another way to put it–at-risk kids live in unsafe environments where they are not fully noticed, cared for, taught, protected, or comforted when they have been hurt. 


## Kinds of Trauma
### Direct physical 
- Abuse
- Injury due to accident
### Direct Verbal/emotional abuse
- “You’re stupid.”
- “You’re worthless.”
- “You’re ugly.”
- “You’re bad.”
- “It’s your fault.” See below.
### Indirect/Observed
- Others being abused
- Caregivers fighting/arguing
- Accident
### Neglect
- Reduces attachment
- “I’m not important”
### Abandonment
- Important person leaves (adult, older sibling etc.)
- Can be due to death or disablement
### Sexual

### Blame for trauma
- Verbal/emotional 
- This is one of the worst
- Most often happens with sexual abuse, where girls get accused of seducing male perpetrators.


## How Trauma Works
### Our connection wiring
- We are made to need each other.
	- Safety 
	- Significance (importance, belonging)


### Our survival wiring
#### Amygdala: our danger alarm
- Processing emotions, especially fear and stress.
- It plays a key role in the formation and storage of emotional memories, including those related to trauma.
- Infancy: pain/discomfort, surprises, harsh voices
- **Impact of Trauma**
    - Trauma can lead to an overactive amygdala, causing heightened emotional responses and increased sensitivity to potential threats.
#### Hippocampus: our memory center


### When something dangerous happens
- Amygdala sounds the alarm
- Hippocampus stores the memory based on the intensity of the alarm
#### When it happens again
- Alarm is louder
- Memory is stronger with more details
#### Contents of a memory
- Pictures
- Sounds
- Smells 
- Emotion
### Multiple traumas
- Amygdala takes over 
- Hippocampus can actually shrink

- **Hippocampus Function**
    - The hippocampus is essential for the formation of new memories and the integration of memories into a coherent narrative.
    - It helps contextualize and situate memories in time and space.
- **Impact of Trauma on the hippocampus**
    - Chronic stress and trauma can impair the hippocampus's functioning, leading to difficulties in forming new memories and recalling specific details of traumatic events.
    - Trauma may cause the hippocampus to shrink, further affecting memory processing and emotional regulation.

### Healthy development 
- Smiles, soft voices, touch
- Baby is naturally wired to respond: recognize faces, voices etc.
- Baby feels discomfort
	- Cries 
	- Adults provide safety and comfort (the two are related)
- Circle of security
	- Adults reinforce importance
		- "Watch me do this!"
		- “Wow you’re so strong!”
	- Adults reinforce protection, learning.
		- “Don’t do that! You’re going to get hurt!”
		- “See I ”
	- Adults reinforce safety
		- Owwwww!!!!!
		- 
	- "Help me!"
	- "Protect me!"
	- Gets tired and hurt
		- Needs adult to comfort

## Characteristics of Someone Living With Untreated Childhood Trauma

### “Accident” prone
Encounters frequent problems due to stress-induced poor judgment

### Physically unhealthy
#### Stress-induced immune weakness or disorder
####  Poor health habits
#### Damage from substance abuse and years of poor health habits
- teeth
- feminine

### Compromised self image


## A child needs to love 
## Common Comorbidities
### Poor social capital

### Lack of family support

## What it’s like to live with trauma
- You don’t want to think about it.
- You don’t want to talk about it.
- You want to somehow make yourself forget it.

## Childhood Trauma → Ongoing trauma
- Boyfriends
- Substances
- Friend dramas


## Factors in evaluating the impact of a trauma event
### Age of occurrence

### If multiple events, frequency and duration over time

### Intensity
- Types of simultaneous abuse
	- E.g. fondling plus threats

### Relationship to perpetrator(s)
### Victim response at the time
- Helpless vs. Able to resist
- Informed adults or not
- Shame 
### Adult response
- Blame the child?
- Help the child?

## Notes
> Trauma, whether it is the result of something done to you or something you yourself have done, almost always makes it difficult to engage in intimate relationships. After you have experienced something so unspeakable, how do you learn to trust yourself or anyone else again? Or, conversely, how can you surrender to an intimate relationship after you have been brutally violated? BodyScore p. 13

For real change to take place, the body needs to learn that the danger has passed and to live in the reality of the present. Bodyscore p. 21

### Parts of the Brain Involved in Recording Trauma Memories

##### 1. **Amygdala**

- **Function**
    - The amygdala is crucial for processing emotions, especially fear and stress.
    - It plays a key role in the formation and storage of emotional memories, including those related to trauma.
- **Impact of Trauma**
    - Trauma can lead to an overactive amygdala, causing heightened emotional responses and increased sensitivity to potential threats.

##### 2. **Hippocampus**

- **Function**
    - The hippocampus is essential for the formation of new memories and the integration of memories into a coherent narrative.
    - It helps contextualize and situate memories in time and space.
- **Impact of Trauma**
    - Chronic stress and trauma can impair the hippocampus's functioning, leading to difficulties in forming new memories and recalling specific details of traumatic events.
    - Trauma may cause the hippocampus to shrink, further affecting memory processing and emotional regulation.

##### 3. **Prefrontal Cortex**

- **Function**
    - The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functions, such as decision-making, planning, and regulating emotions and behavior.
    - It helps in assessing situations, controlling impulses, and moderating the amygdala's emotional responses.
- **Impact of Trauma**
    - Trauma can reduce the activity of the prefrontal cortex, leading to impaired decision-making, emotional regulation, and impulse control.
    - An underactive prefrontal cortex can result in difficulties in distinguishing between safe and dangerous situations.

##### 4. **Hypothalamus**

- **Function**
    - The hypothalamus regulates the body's stress response by controlling the release of stress hormones like cortisol through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
- **Impact of Trauma**
    - Trauma can dysregulate the HPA axis, leading to an overproduction of cortisol, which can affect various bodily functions and contribute to a state of chronic stress.

#### Interaction Between These Brain Regions

- **Amygdala-Hippocampus Connection**
    - The amygdala and hippocampus work closely together to encode and retrieve traumatic memories. The amygdala's emotional intensity can enhance the encoding of these memories in the hippocampus, making them more vivid and persistent.
- **Amygdala-Prefrontal Cortex Connection**
    - The prefrontal cortex helps regulate the amygdala's response to stress and trauma. When this regulation is compromised, the individual may experience heightened anxiety, fear, and reactivity.

#### Effects of Trauma on Memory Processing

- **Intrusive Memories and Flashbacks**
    - Traumatic memories can become intrusive and may be experienced as flashbacks, where the individual feels as though they are reliving the traumatic event.
- **Fragmented Memories**
    - Trauma can lead to fragmented or disjointed memories, making it difficult to form a cohesive narrative of the traumatic experience.
- **Hyperarousal and Hypervigilance**
    - The brain's heightened state of alertness can lead to constant scanning for threats and an exaggerated startle response.

Understanding these brain regions and their roles in processing trauma helps in developing effective trauma-informed care strategies, ensuring that staff can provide appropriate support to residents who have experienced traumatic events.
