Children who have experience sexual abuse may experience complex and conflicting emotions, including pleasure mixed with shame, during and after sexual abuse. This response is rooted in the body’s natural physiological reactions and the intricate ways in which trauma impacts emotional and psychological functioning. Here’s an explanation of how this can occur:

# Types of experience

- All levels of contact–from touching to intercourse
- The level of contact 

## Female predator abuse

## Childhood experimentation

## Observation

### Pornography

## Sensation 
- Fear
- Disgust
- Pleasure
	- The human body can respond to sexual stimulation with physical pleasure, regardless of the context. 
  
## Confusion and shame
- Predators warn not to tell
- Children innately 
- Children may feel confused and ashamed about experiencing physical pleasure during abuse, as they recognize the abusive nature of the act yet cannot reconcile it with the pleasure they felt.
- This can lead to significant internal conflict, guilt, and self-blame.
### Manipulation by the Abuser
- Abusers often manipulate and groom their victims, making the child feel complicit in the abuse. This manipulation can exacerbate feelings of shame and guilt.
- The abuser may exploit the child's natural responses to create a sense of dependency or affection, further complicating the child's emotional experience.

## Long-Term Psychological Effects

### Internal Conflict and Self-Perception
- Survivors may struggle with feelings of shame and self-loathing, believing they were in some way responsible for the abuse because of their physical responses.
- These feelings can contribute to long-term psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.
### Difficulty in Relationships
- Survivors might have difficulties forming healthy relationships, struggling with trust and intimacy due to the conflicted feelings associated with their abuse.
- They may also experience confusion about boundaries and consent, affecting their interactions with others.
### Sexual attraction or obsession
- The hormone cocktail involved in sexual arousal can be extremely addictive. When coupled with a young brain not yet fully wired for rational thinking, a girl can easily become obsessed with sexual thoughts.
- Same-sex attraction is especially common among girls who have experienced sexual abuse. 
	- If abused my men, disgust or hatred of men is common.
	- Abuse by women stimulates the pleasure addiction.

## Trauma-Informed Care

### Addressing Shame and Guilt
- It is crucial for caregivers and therapists to address feelings of shame and guilt in survivors, helping them understand that their physiological responses were normal and not their fault.
- Therapy can focus on separating the physical response from the abusive context, aiding in the healing process.
### Creating a Safe Space
    
- Providing a safe, non-judgmental environment where survivors can express their feelings and experiences is essential for recovery.
- Trauma-informed care should involve validating the survivor's experiences and emotions, helping them rebuild a positive self-image.

## Summary

The experience of pleasure mixed with shame during childhood sexual abuse is a complex issue that stems from the body's natural responses and the manipulative nature of abuse. Understanding and addressing these conflicting feelings is crucial for the healing process, emphasizing the need for compassionate and informed support for survivors.
