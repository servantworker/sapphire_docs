Welcome! We are so glad you have chosen to learn about working with at-risk children. The work you are about to do is very special. Helping and guiding children is one of the most wonderful and important things we can ever do, and something clearly important to Jesus. We promise that in doing this work with maturity and know-how, you will not only impact lives for years to come, but you will be immensely changed and blessed.

# Importance of this work

As an adult leading and teaching children, you will create memories that will impact them for their entire lives. Many years later one might say to her children, “Khru ….” used to say …. Even more than that, we never know what God might call someone to do. A child that you teach may one day be an influential teacher, lawyer, business owner or who knows. Not only will you be building in them what they will need to succeed, but they will pass it on to others. 

Many will enter the program not knowing Jesus at all, while some perhaps will have grown up having heard the Gospel and many Bible stories. But no matter what their background, young minds still have a tremendous number of issues to work through. They will have misunderstandings, believe things that are not true, and have questions and doubts about what they do believe, not only about God and the Bible, but life, friendship, love, family, and what really matters. They are still easily influenced, and your job will be to help them learn the wisdom to consider and choose wisely. 



In this training program, you'll learn how to create a warm, safe environment where children can feel loved and supported. You'll discover practical ways to help them develop important life skills like resilience, empathy, problem-solving, interpersonal communication, mindfulness and many more. You will help them develop wisdom and personal moral character. 

 build strong, trusting relationships with the children you serve. These relationships are so important because they provide a foundation of trust and security. When children know they are cared for, they are more likely to open up, try new things, and believe in themselves.

Safety



As you go through this training, you'll also have the chance to grow personally and spiritually. You'll find ways to strengthen your own faith, improve your communication skills, and take care of yourself so you can be the best support for the children in your care. It's important to remember that taking care of yourself is a key part of being able to take care of others.

This curriculum is designed to be both practical and nurturing, much like the work you'll be doing. Remember, your role is not just a job—it's a calling to make a difference in the lives of young people who need love and guidance.

Together, let's embrace the joy and responsibility of this calling. Let's bring light, hope, and healing to at-risk older children and make a lasting, positive impact on their journey toward a brighter future. I'm so glad you're here, and I can't wait to see the wonderful things you'll do.
