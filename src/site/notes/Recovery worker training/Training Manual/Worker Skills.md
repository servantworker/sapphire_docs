Knowing the Tools
# Definition and Importance

## Skill is knowing how to choose the right tool and then use it in the best way for the need.
## Illustration: nailing two pieces of wood
- Skilled
	- A skilled carpenter chooses the right kind of hammer and nail for the wood he is connecting.
	- He drives the nail straight, hitting it square on the head with each blow, and finishes in a few seconds.
	- The wood is not damaged or split. 
- Unskilled
	- Chooses the wrong size hammer and nail
	- Bends the nail, misses, has to stop and straighten or start over. 
	- Finished one nail in the time the skilled worker drives 10.

Because tools for this kind of work can be conceptual, you may feel a little confused about when something is a tool and when it is a skill. Donâ€™t worry about it. #improve
