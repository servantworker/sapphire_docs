Welcome! We are so glad you have chosen to learn about working with at-risk children. The work you are about to do is very special. Helping and guiding children is one of the most wonderful and important things we can ever do, and something clearly important to Jesus. We promise that in doing this work with maturity and know-how, you will not only impact lives for years to come, but you will be immensely changed and blessed.

# Importance of this work

As an adult leading and teaching children, you will create memories that will impact them for their entire lives. Many years later one might say to her children, “Khru ….” used to say ….  Even more than that, we never know what God might call someone to do. A child that you teach may one day be an influential teacher, lawyer, business owner or who knows. Not only will you be building in them what they will need to succeed, but they will pass it on to others. 

Children you meet may begin by not knowing Jesus at all, while some perhaps will have grown up having heard the Gospel and many Bible stories. But no matter what their background, young minds still have a tremendous number of issues to work through. They will have misunderstandings, believe things that are not true, and have questions and doubts about what they do believe, not only about God and the Bible, but life, friendship, love, family, and what really matters. They are still easily influenced, and your job will be to help them learn the wisdom to consider and choose wisely. 

All children that we consider "at risk" have been hurt. A key topic that we will look at extensively is trauma–how it happens and impacts lives, but most importantly, how you can help in the healing process. Two words you will encounter repeatedly in this course are "safety" and "connection". In learning how to create a safe personal connection with teens, you will also be able to lead them to connect with their Creator, and begin the journey away from brokenness to eternal victory.

You will help them develop wisdom and personal moral character. And you will discover practical ways to help children develop important life skills like resilience, empathy, problem-solving, interpersonal communication, mindfulness and many more. 

As you go through this training, you will find yourself growing personally and spiritually. Your own faith will be strengthened, you will improve your communication skills, and you will learn how to take care of yourself so you can safely love those who may initially reject it. 

Most importantly, you are being trained not how to do a job, but how to follow God's call on you as His child, and make an eternal impact on precious little ones.
